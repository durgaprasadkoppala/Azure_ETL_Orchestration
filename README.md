# 𝘼𝙙𝙫𝙖𝙣𝙘𝙚𝙙 𝙋𝙞𝙥𝙚𝙡𝙞𝙣𝙚 𝙊𝙧𝙘𝙝𝙚𝙨𝙩𝙧𝙖𝙩𝙞𝙤𝙣 𝙬𝙞𝙩𝙝 𝙈𝙞𝙘𝙧𝙤𝙨𝙤𝙛𝙩 𝘼𝙯𝙪𝙧𝙚! 

After completing my initial [project](https://github.com/durgaprasadkoppala/Azure_Cloud) in Microsoft Azure, where I focused on 𝗶𝗻𝗴𝗲𝘀𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝘁𝗿𝗮𝗻𝘀𝗳𝗼𝗿𝗺𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗣𝗮𝘆𝗣𝗮𝗹 𝗱𝗮𝘁𝗮, I took things further with a new challenge: orchestrating complex pipelines to ensure a smooth, end-to-end data flow.

Building on the first project’s foundations, this project involved:

🔹 𝙎𝙚𝙦𝙪𝙚𝙣𝙩𝙞𝙖𝙡 𝘿𝙖𝙩𝙖 𝙄𝙣𝙜𝙚𝙨𝙩𝙞𝙤𝙣 – Setting up multiple data sources to flow in a controlled sequence, with each step triggering the next upon successful ingestion.

🔹 𝘼𝙪𝙩𝙤𝙢𝙖𝙩𝙚𝙙 𝙀𝙧𝙧𝙤𝙧 𝙃𝙖𝙣𝙙𝙡𝙞𝙣𝙜 – Adding failure notifications with detailed messages and error codes, so any ingestion issues can be quickly diagnosed and addressed.

🔹 𝙋𝙞𝙥𝙚𝙡𝙞𝙣𝙚 𝙀𝙭𝙚𝙘𝙪𝙩𝙞𝙤𝙣 – Using an execute pipeline step to transform and store data in Azure SQL Database seamlessly.

🔹 𝙁𝙞𝙣𝙖𝙡 𝘿𝙖𝙩𝙖 𝙀𝙭𝙥𝙤𝙧𝙩 – Creating a new data flow to extract the final transformed data and export it as a CSV file to Azure Blob Storage, making the data accessible and ready for analysis.
